What do you want in the initial release?

In version 1 of the initial release I want an app that records a decent amount of statistics for the various categories. 
These statistics should be viewable by the user both in real time when they open up the tric detail and a history of the previously recorded times.
There should be several different graph options of being able to see the features and doing things like sort by highest, lowest, get the average.

The user should be able to set which tric they want to monitor and which ones they do not.

I really want it to look good. Interface is key in the first version

-Add more trics

-Rework tric/stats naming system



TO DO
- Need a name in preferences to know which one we are editing.
- Fix bug with chart when displaying more than screen size.
- Add some sort of push graphic for the pie
- Add a service that polls for new updates when on mainactivity

Add IP or identification for upload to server.


FOR DESIGN:

Have it themed like "metrics" or "statistics" with some sort of graph representing the GUI
- Initial main activity is static, have it load up like a sideways bar graph with different bright colors.
