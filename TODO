Create detail view in which we can pass it a tric and maybe a type for data and have it display the stat for the tric
	- Also have a link to the preferences for the tric
	- In the future have a chart view
	- Have filter based on day/month/year/all time
	- Select highest / lowest / average / median / stdev
	
Going to have to create new DatabaseQuerys 
	- Select highest
	- Select lowest
	- Select average
	- Select Median
	- Select standard deviation
	- Be able to filter all the results based on timeframes
	
	
Instead of highest/lowest/etc which returns 1 result we could also return the next highest etc results if they want.
