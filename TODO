Create detail view in which we can pass it a tric and maybe a type for data and have it display the stat for the tric
	- Also have a link to the preferences for the tric
	- In the future have a chart view
	- Have a button for force refersh
	
Want a main name and detail name for each tric 

	
	
Instead of highest/lowest/etc which returns 1 result we could also return the next highest etc results if they want.

FOR DESIGN:

Have it themed like "metrics" or "statistics" with some sort of graph representing the GUI
- Initial main activity is static, have it load up like a sideways bar graph with different bright colors.
